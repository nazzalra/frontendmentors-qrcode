## My process

- Use Mobile-first workflow by resizing preview width to 375px
- Identify the Structure
  - create main element that has card class. the element group card image, title and subtitle
- Working with styles
  - import the desired font
  - set base style
  - set card styles like max-width, padding, backgroundcolor, etc.
  - position the card to the center both horizontally and vertically by set the body element as a flex container and set both alignitems and justifycontent values to center
  - set card image styles
  - set card title styles
  - set card subtitle styles
  - Refactor styles
    - use custom properties / variables if needed

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Benefit of repetition to solidify the knowledge especially CSS.

### Continued development

Implement same idea maybe using preprocessor like SCSS, using different layouting technique like flexbox or grid
